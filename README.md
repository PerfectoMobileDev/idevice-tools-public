# idevice-tools-public

idevice-tools is Perfecto's adaptation of libimobiledevice and contained tools (https://github.com/libimobiledevice).
This is a visual studio project that runs on Windows. Main changes introduced are adding -I and -P parameters enabling the respective tools to work against a remote host / port rather than the local USBMux daemon.
All library code and respective tools maintain the original licenses.
